## üîß Troubleshooting

### Processing Not Working
The processing functionality has been fixed to use the original workflow. If you still have issues:

1. **Check the logs**: The dashboard shows real-time logs during processing
2. **Verify dependencies**: Make sure Whisper, Ollama, and FFmpeg are working
3. **Check file format**: Ensure your video files are in supported formats

### App Won't Start
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed
2. Check that all dependencies are installed: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Try the `.command` file instead for more detailed error messages

### Port Already in Use
The app automatically uses port 5001 to avoid conflicts with macOS AirPlay.

3. **Keep App Open**: Don't close the dashboard app while processing
